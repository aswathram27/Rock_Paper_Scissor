# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This HTML document creates a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that can be played directly in a web browser. The structure is defined by HTML, which includes a title, a set of buttons for user interactions, and a section for displaying the results. The game logic is managed by a JavaScript function named play, which takes the user’s choice as an argument. When a button is clicked, this function generates a random choice for the computer from the options 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. It then compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the outcome of the game. The results are displayed dynamically on the webpage, showing the user's choice, the computer's choice, and whether the game ended in a win, loss, or tie.

The CSS included in the <style> tag provides visual styling for the game. It centers the content on the page and applies a background image that covers the entire viewport. The buttons are styled with padding, a larger font size, and a background color to make them more prominent and clickable. The text and button styles are designed to be clear and readable against the background. Specifically, the text color is set to white, and the buttons have a slightly different color to stand out. The layout ensures that the game is visually appealing and easy to interact with.

Overall, this document combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a complete, interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Users can click on one of the buttons to make a choice, and the game provides immediate feedback on the outcome of each round. The design choices and coding practices ensure that the game is both functional and visually engaging, making it a straightforward example of a client-side web application.
